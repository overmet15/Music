# Met's music projects dump

Here, i dump all music stuff i made, they can be unrelated to anything or be simple sketches i may use in future, or they can have their own license or belong to an project, make sure to check before doing anything.

However, remixing, and using in you projects IS ALLOWED ASLONG AS THE CREATOR(s) ARE CREDITED.

IF YOU PLAN ON USING ANYTHING, MAKE SURE IT DOESNT BELONG TO OTHER PROJECT.  
AND IF YOU WANT TO USE SOMETHING FROM SKETCHES, EXCEPT ME TO RELEASE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN FUTURE.

## Sketches
Sketches are unfinished, or test projects. I may never use them, i may will release them, or maybe even bundle with other song, who knows.
However, they may be randomly updated, so, except seing small sketch turn into big song or bunch of trash.
