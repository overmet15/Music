# Met's music projects dump

This is a place where I dump all the music stuff I've made. These tracks can be unrelated experiments, simple sketches, or pieces tied to other projects. Some may have their own licenses or be part of something larger—**make sure to check before using anything**.

### Usage Guidelines
- **Remixing is allowed**, as long as **the original creator(s) are credited**.
- **Before using any track**, make sure it’s not part of another project.
- If you're using a **draft**, expect that I might release a finalized version of it in the future.
- For more info check the [FAQ](FAQ.md)

If project files are missing or something is wrong or you just have questions, feel free to make issue.
 
## Sketches
Sketches are unfinished or test projects. I may never release them, or they might evolve into full songs or be bundled with other works. They can be updated at any time—don’t be surprised if a small idea turns into a full track or just disappears.

## Notice
**Before using any of these songs in your own project(s), please DM [@overmet15](https://github.com/overmet15) and ask first!**
