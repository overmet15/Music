# Met's music projects dump

Here, i dump all music stuff i made, they can be unrelated to anything or be simple sketches i may use in future, or they can have their own license or belong to an project, make sure to check before doing anything.

However, remixing, and using in you projects IS ALLOWED ASLONG AS THE CREATOR(s) ARE CREDITED.

IF YOU PLAN ON USING ANYTHING, MAKE SURE IT DOESNT BELONG TO OTHER PROJECT.  
AND IF YOU WANT TO USE SOMETHING FROM SKETCHES, EXCEPT ME TO RELEASE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN FUTURE.
